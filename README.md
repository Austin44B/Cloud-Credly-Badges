In earning the Cloud+ [Architecture](https://www.credly.com/badges/257ce92a-0d1c-4486-9ff6-2be8973954bf/public_url) badge : 

I learned how to plan and design a cloud environment by using cloud service provider pricing calculators from both Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS to plan deployment costs and estimate operation expenses. I then explored available cloud resource configurations as part of the cloud migration. 

I then learned how to Deploy and manage cloud resources within Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS through creating a proof of concept virtualization deployment by first exploring the available AWS console interface. I then created a resource group to manage a DEV department's AWS resources. And finally, I deployed, configured and scaled a virtual machine in a Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and organized it by displaying associated resources using tags. 

The CompTia Cloud+ Architecture badge covers exam objectives in sections, 1.2, 1.4, and 3.1

In earning the Cloud+ [Operations](https://www.credly.com/badges/c68aa762-7da1-40c8-86bb-e0d1a31f75b6/public_url) badge : 

In learning how to manage compute resources in Amazon AWS. I identified common services for AWS using the AWS console, then examined the instance store attached to an EC2 instance, then using the AWS Console I created a new block storage volume and attached an EBS volume to the EC2 instance, I then modified the EBS volume by increasing its capacity, I then set up metrics in the dashboard that AWS captures for the block storage device.

Elastic Block store (EBS) volumes provide block-level storage for elastic compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Instantiating an EC2 instance requires a storage volume to hold the operating system. This device is known as an instance store. Its size is dependent on the instance type, and the volume only persists while the instance is running (or rebooted). Note that any data stored on the instance store will be lost if the instance state is either stopped, hibernated, or terminated. In addition, additional block storage devices can be created and attached to an instance to give it more storage. 

I also learned how to manage compute resources for Microsoft Azure by configuring additional storage for a existing virtual machine instance, resizing existing storage to increase capacity and configuring a cloud-based NFS share. 

After learning how to manage compute resources, I then was able to learn how to manage cloud networks for both Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. While working in AWS I created a proof-of-concept virtualization deployment and a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). And for Azure I created a virtual network (vnet) and deployed corresponding subnets while documenting the configuration along the way with a network diagram and organizing the network with security rules. 

Wrapping up the Operation badge, I learned how to manage baseline configurations for AWS by reviewing the indentity and access management (IAM) function within AWS. With IAM, I amâ€¦. ( pun intended )  to add and remove AWS user accounts and groups, and create and manage roles and policies that control what operations users and services can perform. IAM within AWS is one of a suite of capabilities that can be used to secure and maintain cloud deployments. For a further deep dive about AWS security components, check out the documentation on  AWS Security, Identity, and Compliance.

The CompTia Cloud+ Operations badge covers exam objectives in sections, 2.3,  3.2, 3.3.

In earning the Cloud+ [Security](https://www.credly.com/badges/594e2bff-ba6a-4eb7-8185-ae511647d9b2/public_url) badge : 

I learned how to secure cloud components in Azure by deploying a virtual network that represented a production environment, I then created a windows VM in the production virtual network and finally configured peering between the production virtual network and a dev virtual network that was already created. 

Another part of the Security badge for Cloud+ is knowing how to monitor and deploy patches, in which I navigated the compliance dashboard for AWS to remain aware of which instances needed to be updated and did so for a AWS EC2 instance that needed to be updated by using the AWS system manager.

Wrapping up the Security badge, It is a key function of cloud deployments to understand application health and performance to improve the customer experience, increase developer productivity, and to gain insights into potential enhancements. I learned how AWS includes several services to support this by configuring monitoring for AWS services and maintaining deployments by creating a CloudWatch dashboard that monitors EC2 metrics and research and displays access to AWS environments with CloudTrail. I also created a simple notification service (SNS) topic to generate an email when CloudWatch event rules fire. Further education on what I did can be learned by using SNS and CloudWatch Events from the AWS documentation.

The CompTia Cloud+ Security badge covers exam objectives in sections, 2.1, 4.1.

In earning the Cloud+ [Troubleshooting](https://www.credly.com/badges/f9be9273-99c3-4edd-b8eb-48b73cd158ba/public_url) badge : 

I learned how security is a key component of configuring and using cloud environments whether they be private, public, or hybrid. As a result, every cloud vendor supports a multitude of capabilities to help you do that. In learning how to secure and troubleshoot AWS, I used the AWS console to view, create, use, and monitor the security of virtual networks using several innate tools.

I then learned how to monitor cloud resources in Azure by configuring custom dashboards for monitoring, reviewing resource group monitoring tools, virtual machine alerts and extensions, and virtual network metrics. I first configured a custom dashboard and then added tiles to it for specific resource metrics, I also configured alerts and actions groups for a resource group and virtual machine. A nice feature that Azure offers is providing a default cloud dashboard for administrators, this dashboard can be customized on a per user basis, and even be saved and uploaded for standardization. 

Wrapping up the troubleshooting badge I learned how to manage backup and restore processes for an Azure VM instance, by executing a manual OS disk snapshot and creating a new storage disk from the snapshot. 

The CompTia Cloud+ Troubleshooting badge covers exam objectives in sections, 2.2, 4.1, 4.5.
